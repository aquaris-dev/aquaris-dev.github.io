## How can I contribute?

## OMG, I found a bug/issue &ndash; help!!

Sorry to hear that! We put a lot of effort into building our releases, but we'd always like to be better. Please report bugs on the [GitHub issue page](https://github.com/aquaris-dev) for the corresponding device project, and we can look into it ASAP!

## Exciting, but how can I help out?

Since we're an open source project, you can help out by submitting a patch either as a pull request to our GitHub [repo/organization](https://github.com/aquaris-dev) for WiP projects (devices etc.) or to the LineageOS [Gerrit](https://review.lineageos.org/#/q/status:open) instance for officially supported projects. 

Supplying good bug reports (logs, screenshots, reproduction steps) helps us to track down issues. We're excited for your contribution to make Android even better on BQ devices.
