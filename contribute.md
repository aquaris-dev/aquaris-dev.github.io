## How can I contribute?

This is an Open Source project and it depends on your help to make it better.  
There are many ways for you to help:

### Share your feedback

Let us know if you like our work. Use the comment form on the [blog posts](/blog.html).

### Report bugs

We put a lot of effort into building our releases, but we'd always like to be better. Please report bugs on the [GitHub issue page](https://github.com/aquaris-dev) for the corresponding device project, and we can look into it ASAP!

Supplying good bug reports (logs, screenshots, reproduction steps) helps us to track down issues. 

### Improve the code

Since we're an open source project, you can help out by submitting a patch either as a pull request to our GitHub [repo/organization](https://github.com/aquaris-dev) for WiP projects (devices etc.) or to the LineageOS [Gerrit](https://review.lineageos.org/#/q/status:open) instance for officially supported projects. 

### More information

See [http://lineageos.org/community/](http://lineageos.org/community/) for more information on how you can help.

We're excited for your contribution to make Android even better on BQ devices.
