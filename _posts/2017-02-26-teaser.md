We've got a little teaser to show you what we've been up to.

![tenshi]({{ site.url }}/images/tenshi-cm13.jpg)

Users of our current devices(http://aquaris-dev.org/devices.html) should not feel left out as we're still hard at work with cm-13.0/cm-14.1.

Feel free to submit patches if you are a developer..

We even have official weeklies(https://download.lineageos.org) of LineageOS for some of these supported devices.
