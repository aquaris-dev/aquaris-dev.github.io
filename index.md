## What is Aquaris-dev?

Aquaris-dev is a group of independent Android developers whose members voluntarily work on [BQ](https://www.bq.com/) Aquaris devices as official maintainers of the [LineageOS](http://lineageos.org/) Android <nobr>custom ROM</nobr>. We aim to provide the newest version of Android (LineageOS) for as many of the latest BQ Aquaris devices. We contribute our work to the LineageOS project (previously, we worked on CyanogenMod).

### Which devices do we support?

We only support Qualcomm based BQ devices like: <nobr>Aquaris E5 LTE (vegetalte)</nobr>, <nobr>Aquaris M5 (piccolo)</nobr>, <nobr>Aquaris X5 (paella)</nobr>, <nobr>Aquaris X5 Plus (gohan)</nobr>.  
Check the [devices page](/devices.html) for more information. 

### Where can you get our work?

Official nightly builds and stable releases can be downloaded on the [LineageOS download](https://download.lineageos.org) page. 

We also have active forum threads incl. installation instructions and download links on [htcmania.com](http://www.htcmania.com/forumdisplay.php?f=2091) for Spanish speaking users and on [android-hilfe.de](http://www.android-hilfe.de/forum/bq-forum.2047/) for German speaking users. 

### Is the source code available?

Absolutely! Android is an open source project, and so is ours. All code used to build our ROMs is available on GitHub, either directly from us at [Aquaris-dev](https://github.com/aquaris-dev) for device specific projects or as part of [LineageOS](https://github.com/lineageos) for the main system.
